# Browser Widget Charts

For this workshop you will need a version of LiveCode 9 installed and a text
editor which can ideally view a folder of files. You will want to be connected
to wifi so you can view the [Chart.js online docs.](https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/)

We will be creating the `Chart.js Playground.livecode` file which is provided
for reference so it's probably best to avoid looking at it too closely before
you complete the workshop.

If you have some sample data that you would like to create charts for then
please bring it along. I hope to spend the end of the session helping people
work on parsing their data into the format required for the chart type and
options they would like to use.
