							<h2>I. General information about data processing</h2>

							<h3>1. Coverage of personal data processing</h3>

							<p>In principle, we process personal data of our users only insofar as this is necessary to provide a functioning website as well as our content and services. The processing of personal data of our users takes place only with the consent of the user. An exception applies to cases in which prior consent can not be obtained for reasons of fact and the processing of the data is permitted by law.</p>


							<h3>2. Legal basis for the processing of personal data</h3>

							<p>Insofar as we obtain the consent of the data subject for processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) serves as legal basis.<br>
							In the processing of personal data necessary for the fulfillment of a contract to which the data subject is a party, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR serves as legal basis. This also applies to processing operations required to carry out pre-contractual actions.<br>
							Insofar as processing of personal data is required to fulfill a legal obligation that is subject to our company, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. c GDPR serves as legal basis.<br>
							In the event that vital interests of the data subject or another natural person require the processing of personal data, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. d GDPR serves as legal basis.<br>
							If processing is necessary to safeguard the legitimate interests of our company or a third party, and if the interest, fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject do not prevail over the first interest, Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR serves as legal basis for processing.</p>


							<h3>3. Data erasure and storage duration</h3>

							<p>The personal data of the person in question will be deleted or blocked as soon as the purpose of the storage is inapplicable. In addition, such storage may occur if this was provided by the European or national legislator in EU regulations, laws or other regulations to which the controller is subject. Blocking or deletion of the data also takes place when a storage period prescribed by the standards mentioned expires, unless there is a need for further storage of the data for conclusion of a contract or fulfillment of the contract.</p>


							<h2>II. Provision of the website and creation of log files</h2>

							<h3>1. Description and scope of data processing</h3>

							<p>Each time our website is accessed, our system automatically collects data and information from the computer system of the calling computer.<br>
							The following data is collected on this occasion:</p>

							<p>(1) Information about the browser type and version used<br>
							(2) The operating system of the user<br>
							(3) The IP address of the user<br>
							(4) Date and time of access<br>
							(5) Websites from which the system of the user comes to our website</p>

							<h3>2. Legal basis for data processing</h3>

							<p>The legal basis for the temporary storage of data and log files is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.</p>

							<h3>3. Purpose of data processing</h3>

							<p>The temporary storage of the IP address by the system is necessary to allow delivery of the website to the computer of the user. To do this, the user's IP address must be kept for the duration of the session.<br>
							Storage in log files is done to ensure the functionality of the website. In addition, the data is used to optimize the website and to ensure the security of our information technology systems. An evaluation of the data for marketing purposes does not take place in this context.</p>

							<p>Our legitimate interest in the processing of data according to Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR also lies in these purposes.</p>

							<h3>4. Duration of storage</h3>

							<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. In the case of collecting the data for providing the website, this is the case when the respective session is completed.<br>
							In the case of storing the data in log files, this is the case after no more than one month. An additional storage is possible. In this case, the IP addresses of the users are deleted or alienated, so that an assignment of the calling client is no longer possible.</p>

							<h3>5. Opposition and removal possibility</h3>


							<p>The collection of data for the provision of the website and the storage of the data in log files is essential for the operation of the website. There is consequently no contradiction on the part of the user.</p>


							<h2>III. Contact form and e-mail contact</h2>


							<p>On our website is a contact form available, which can be used for electronic contact. If a user uses this possibility, the data entered in the input mask will be transmitted to us and saved. These data are:</p>

							<p>(1) The email address of the user<br>
							(2) Subject of the message of the user<br>
							(3) The message of the user</p>

							<p>At the time of sending the message, the following data is also stored:</p>

							<p>(1) The IP address of the user<br>
							(2) Date and time of registration</p>

							<p>For the processing of the data in the context of the sending process your consent is obtained and referred to this privacy notice.<br>
							Alternatively, contact via the provided e-mail address is possible. In this case, the user's personal data transmitted by e-mail will be stored.<br>
							In this context, there is no disclosure of the data to third parties. The data is used exclusively for processing the conversation.</p>


							<h3>2. Legal basis for data processing</h3>


							<p>Legal basis for the processing of the data is in the presence of the consent of the user Art. 6 para. 1 lit. a GDPR.<br>
							The legal basis for the processing of the data transmitted in the course of sending an e-mail is Article 6 (1) lit. f GDPR. If the e-mail contact aims to conclude a contract, then additional legal basis for the processing is Art. 6 para. 1 lit. b GDPR.</p>



							<h3>3. Purpose of data processing</h3>

							<p>The processing of the personal data from the input mask serves us only to process the contact. In the case of contact via e-mail, this also includes the required legitimate interest in the processing of the data.<br>
							The other personal data processed during the sending process serve to prevent misuse of the contact form and to ensure the security of our information technology systems.</p>


							<h3>4. Duration of storage</h3>

							<p>The data will be deleted as soon as it is no longer necessary for the purpose of its collection. For the personal data from the input form of the contact form and those sent by e-mail, this is the case when the respective conversation with the user has ended. The conversation is ended when it can be inferred from the circumstances that the relevant facts have been finally clarified.<br>
							The additional personal data collected during the sending process will be deleted at the latest after a period of one month.</p>


							<h3>5. Opposition and removal possibility</h3>

							<p>The user has the possibility at any time to revoke his consent to the processing of the personal data. If the user contacts us by e-mail, he may object to the storage of his personal data at any time. In such a case, the conversation can not continue.<br>
							Please contact the contact person responsible for data protection as indicated above.<br>
							All personal data stored in the course of contacting will be deleted in this case.</p>
