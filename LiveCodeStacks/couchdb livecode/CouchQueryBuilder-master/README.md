lcCouchQueryBuilder
===================

This is a LiveCode library that can be used to build CouchDB queries with less coding effort spent.

lcCouchQueryBuilder has a dependency called lcLibJson. You can download lcLibJson from here:

https://github.com/chstrong/lcLibJson

If you think that you require a different library for JSON/Array conversion such as mergJson for example you can change the methods in the functions right at the bottom of lcCouchQueryBuilder source code.

* couchJsonToArray
* couchArrayToJson
