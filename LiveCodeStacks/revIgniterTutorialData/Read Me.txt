revIgniter Tutorial

Building dynamic web pages with revIgniter.

------------------------------------------


Don't forget to replace the action attributes in
chatcontent.irev and chatlogin.irev with the proper URL.

Make sure, that all settings in your database.irev file
are correct, that gActiveRecord is set to TRUE and
that your database contains the "chat" table
(a database dump is included).
