Collection of LiveCode developer information and Code Stacks

Please honor the developer's rights as noted by them.


LiveCode is a compile free language so you can run and edit your application live, allowing you to add code gradually, and develop iteratively, testing as you go, with no compile time or delay. ... That means you can build any application you create to run on Windows, Mac OS, Linux, iOS, Android or a server. https://livecode.com or http://livecode.org/ for open source version
