The `builds` folder is where the Levure packager puts your application distribution builds. Read the [packager documentation](packager) to learn about what goes into the `builds` folder.

You can customize the name and location of the build folder in `app.yml`. By default the name of the build folder is `builds` and the location is in your application project folder alongside your `app` folder.
