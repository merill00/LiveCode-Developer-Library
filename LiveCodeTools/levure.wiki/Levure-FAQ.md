## I'm being asked to save the LevureStandalone (standalone.livecode) stack 

On exiting LiveCode you may sometimes see tge *Do you want to save changes to stack “LevureStandalone” and all other stacks in the file “standalone.livecode” before closing?* dialog appear. Unless you explicitly modified the stack don't save it. The stack is invisible at that point and you don't want to save it in an invisible state.
