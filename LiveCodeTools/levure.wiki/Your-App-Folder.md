Your `app` folder is where most of your work takes place when developing a Levure application. This folder is where your application-specific stacks, scripts, and other assets are stored.

When you first set up your project, the [Levure application project creator](Creating-an-Application) creates an `app` folder with an application skeleton to get you started.

Your `app` folder structure will look similar to this:

* :open_file_folder: your_application_project_folder
  - :open_file_folder: app
    - [app.yml](app.yml)
    - [app.livecodescript](app.livecodescript)
    - [standalone.livecode](standalone.livecode)
    - :file_folder: [assets](assets)
    - :file_folder: [backscripts](frontscripts-and-backscripts)
    - :file_folder: [behaviors](behaviors)
    - :file_folder: [extensions](extensions)
    - :file_folder: [frontscripts](frontscripts-and-backscripts)
    - :file_folder: [helpers](helpers)
    - :file_folder: [libraries](libraries)
    - :file_folder: [ui](ui)
  - :file_folder: builds
  - :file_folder: levure
