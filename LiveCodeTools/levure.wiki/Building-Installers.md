While Levure doesn't build installers for desktop applications, you can install (or create) a helper that will automate most, if not all, of the process. If you are using Levure 0.9.1 or later you can download any of the following helpers to use in your application:

## macOS
- DropDMG: https://github.com/trevordevore/levurehelper-dropDMG

## Windows
- Inno Setup: https://github.com/trevordevore/levurehelper-inno_setup
