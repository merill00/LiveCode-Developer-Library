## Get LiveCode

You can get LiveCode at [livecode.com](http://www.livecode.com) (commercial version) or [livecode.org](http://www.livecode.org) (community edition). Levure works with all editions of LiveCode 8 and higher.

## Install Git (optional)

Git is not required to use Levure, however Levure works well with Git and GitHub. If you don't already have Git installed on your computer, follow these [installation instructions](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

The advantages of using Git to manage your development are:

1. It makes it easy to keep the Levure framework updated to the latest version.

2. It allows you to enjoy the proven benefits of version control to manage your application development.

3. It allows you to use GitHub and take advantage of industry standard version control, collaboration, and documentation features.
