Extensions for LiveCode 8

This repository contains widgets that I have made available to the community.

## How do I use the widgets?

The repository contains the source code for the widgets. You will find an `.lcb` file in each widget folder. It doesn't contain any .lce packages that you can install using the Extension Manager. Once you've downloaded the widget folder(s), open the .lcb file in the Extension Builder where you can test or install the widget.

## Install widget_helpers

Install the widget_helpers extension first. It is a module containing handlers that some of the widgets use. The handlers may prove useful in your own widgets as well.
