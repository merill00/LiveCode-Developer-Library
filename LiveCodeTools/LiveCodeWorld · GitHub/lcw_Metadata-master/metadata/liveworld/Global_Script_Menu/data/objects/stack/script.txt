/*
This is the menu called by the Script Editor and other tools that work on scriptObjects.

The menu_target for these handlers is the scriptObject that owns the script currently presented by the Script Editor.
These menu tools should therefore work equally well on any LiveCode object,
and in particular either along side any of the more specific version control tools for GIT or Fossil.
