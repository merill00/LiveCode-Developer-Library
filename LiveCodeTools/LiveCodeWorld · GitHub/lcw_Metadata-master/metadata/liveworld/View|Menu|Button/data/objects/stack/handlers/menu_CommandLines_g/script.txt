getprop menu_CommandLines [mTitle]
   -- could remove "on" and lines that are "_" ???
   put the script_Suite [mTitle] of the target into comLines	# "someScript" allows searching for handlers outside of suite (slower)
   -- let's not allow "command" for "menus" for speed reasons (they are message handlers after all)
   filter comLines with "on *"
   return comLines
