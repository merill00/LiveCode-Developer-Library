getprop menu_Title
   -- simple version that does not refer to menu_Controller, local burn then default if empty
   -- can be over-ridden by a menu_Title handler in the card script
   -- so try to avoid putting these handers in a views script
   
   put the long id of the target into targetObject
   get the name of targetObject
   put the menu_BurntTitle of targetObject into mTitle
   if mTitle is not empty then return mTitle
   put the menu_DefaultTitle of targetObject into mTitle
   -- if mTitle is empty then put "Menu" into mTitle
   return mTitle
end menu_Title
