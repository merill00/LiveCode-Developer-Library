   /*
   In my workflow I try to use the index (staging area) and last commit efficiently. 
   Very often I will commit something partially working with a "work in progress" commit message to tell myself that I am not done. 
   As I work I will git commit --amend to that commit.
   It may look like:
   
   # hack hack hack
   git add foo.c
   git commit -m"WIP: hacking on this and that"
   
   # hack hack hack
   git add -p bar.c
   git commit --amend
   
   I have typed git commit --amend a lot. Typing it is not so bad, but this command also invokes an editor. 
   Most of the time, I am not interested in what the editor is there for -- to update the commit message.
   Enter git amend:
   
   git config --global alias.amend 'commit --amend -C HEAD'
   
   This alias adds a git amend command that will reuse the current commit message when it amend it.
   It's the little things :)
