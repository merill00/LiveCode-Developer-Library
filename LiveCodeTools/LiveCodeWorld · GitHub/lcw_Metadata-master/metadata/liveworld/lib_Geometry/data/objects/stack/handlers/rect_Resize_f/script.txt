function rect_Resize someRect, someWidth, someHeight
   -- a quick hack (speed up and simplify!)
   put rect_GetCentre(someRect) into fromLoc
   if someWidth is not empty then put item 1 of someRect + someWidth into item 3 of someRect
   if someHeight is not empty then put item 2 of someRect + someHeight into item 4 of someRect
   put rect_GetCentre(someRect) into toLoc
   put loc_TranslationVector (fromLoc, toLoc, xVector, yVector) into someVector
   put rect_TranslateByVector (someRect, xVector, yVector) into newRect
   return newRect
end rect_Resize
