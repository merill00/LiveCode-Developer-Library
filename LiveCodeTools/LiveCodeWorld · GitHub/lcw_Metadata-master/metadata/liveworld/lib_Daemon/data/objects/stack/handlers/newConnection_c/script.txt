   This handler is the first step of a new connection. It will start processing the connections and pipeing the control to the handler called "proccessRequest"
   
   pDropDelay is the number of seconds that a connection that never completed is kept around in SocketData before it is purged. 
   In this case, I assume that if we don't get a fully formed set of data within 10 minutes of the initial connection, it's not going to happen.
