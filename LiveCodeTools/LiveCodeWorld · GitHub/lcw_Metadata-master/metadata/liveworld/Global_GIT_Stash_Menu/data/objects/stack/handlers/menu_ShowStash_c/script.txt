   Show the changes recorded in the stash as a diff between the stashed state and its original parent. 
   When no <stash> is given, shows the latest one. By default, the command shows the diffstat, 
   but it will accept any format known to git diff (e.g., git stash show -p stash@{1} to view the second most recent stash in patch form).
