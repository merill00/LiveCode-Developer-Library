    -- Revolution array keys are never guaranteed to be in order you created-- them in so we must come up with some other way of maintaining-- proper sequence. For arrays representing XML, the XML syntax is-- used (i.e. node[1], node[2], etc.). This handler will sort keys that use-- this syntax for representing sequence.
