function script_DictionaryTerm someWord
   if char 1 to 3 of someWord is "rev" and char 4 of someWord is not "_" then return true -- a bit risky to assume this!
   
   put rev_DictionaryTerms() into knownTerms
   set the wholematches to true
   return someWord is among the words of knownTerms
end script_DictionaryTerm
