Not being used right now. Instead we index hap_Art.

In the future this might be a front script of before handerl behavior of the library for use on Desktop?

These handlers we extract from the HAP revIgniter application code.
They may have been modified slightly in order to make them independent of server side functionality, or to be made more readable.
This allows for testing and use in Desktop and mobile clients.
