    by using the -I option (which will make curl issue a HEAD request).
    
    Curl does not follow Location: headers by default,
    but will simply display such pages in the same manner it display all HTTP replies.
    It does however feature an option that will make it attempt to follow the Location: pointers.
    To tell curl to follow a Location:
    curl -L www.sitethatredirects.com
    if you use curl to post to a site that immediately redirects you to another page,
    you can safely use -L and -d/-F together.
    Curl will only use post in the first request, and then revert to get in the following operations.
