         The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server
         understands the content type of the request entity (hence a
         415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the
         syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request)
         status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained
         instructions.  For example, this error condition may occur if an XML
         request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but
         semantically erroneous, XML instructions.
