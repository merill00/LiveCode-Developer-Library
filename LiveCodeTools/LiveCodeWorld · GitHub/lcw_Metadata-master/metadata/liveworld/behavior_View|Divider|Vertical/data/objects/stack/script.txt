/*
This is a bit of a mess. Fix it up.

The geometry of this view is not stable 
It can get trapped in a situation where the geometry needs resetting as the local variables are no cleared,
as a mouseUp or mouseLeave event is not sent and so clear_move is never called.

Resizing the view should fix this as a short term hack, but the code needs fixing to make it more robust.
This layout allows you to resize two horzontally divided panes.
It should be updated to use one LocalArray, and maybe dispatch?
