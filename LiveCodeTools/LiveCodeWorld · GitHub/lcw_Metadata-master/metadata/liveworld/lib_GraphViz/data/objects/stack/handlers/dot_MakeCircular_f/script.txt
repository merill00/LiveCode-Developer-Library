    /*
    circodraws graphs using a circular layout (see Six and Tollis, GD ’99 and ALENEX ’99, and Kaufmann 
    and Wiese, GD ’02.) The tool identifies biconnected components and draws the nodes of the component on 
    acircle. The block-cutpoint tree is then laid out using a recursive radial algorithm. Edge crossings within a 
    circle are minimized by placing as manyedges on the circle’sperimeter as possible. In particular, if the 
    component is outerplanar,the component will have a planar layout. 
    If a node belongs to multiple non-trivial biconnected components, the layout puts the node in one of them. 
    By default, this is the first non-trivial component found in the search from the root component.
