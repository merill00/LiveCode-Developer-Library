   Computes the transitive reduction of directed graphs, and prints the resulting graphs to standard output. 
   This removes edges implied by transitivity. Nodes and subgraphs are not otherwise affected. 
   The “meaning” and validity of the reduced graphs is application dependent. 
   tred is particularly useful as a preprocessor to dot to reduce clutter in dense layouts.
