command fossil_Checkout fossilCheckoutFolder, pVersion
   /*
   Usage: fossil checkout ?VERSION | --latest? ?OPTIONS?
   or: fossil co ?VERSION | --latest? ?OPTIONS?
   
   Check out a version specified on the command-line.  This command
   will abort if there are edited files in the current checkout unless
   the --force option appears on the command-line.  The --keep option
   leaves files on disk unchanged, except the manifest and manifest.uuid
   files.
   
   The --latest flag can be used in place of VERSION to checkout the
   latest version in the repository.
   
   Options:
   --force   Ignore edited files in the current checkout
   --keep    Only update the manifest and manifest.uuid files
