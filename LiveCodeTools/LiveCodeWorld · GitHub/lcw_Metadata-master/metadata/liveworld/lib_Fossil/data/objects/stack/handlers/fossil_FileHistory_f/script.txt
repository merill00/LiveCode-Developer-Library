   /*
   fossil finfo {?-l|--log? / -s|--status / --p|--print} FILENAME
   
   Print the complete change history for a single file going backwards
   in time.  The default is -l.
   
   For the -l|--log option: If "-b|--brief" is specified one line per revision
   is printed, otherwise the full comment is printed.  The "--limit N"
   and "--offset P" options limits the output to the first N changes
   after skipping P changes.
   
   In the -s form prints the status as <status> <revision>.  This is
   a quick status and does not check for up-to-date-ness of the file.
   
   The -p form, there's an optional flag "-r|--revision REVISION".  The
   specified version (or the latest checked out version) is printed to
   stdout.
