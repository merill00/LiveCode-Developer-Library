command fossil_Sync pFossilFileOrCheckout, pUrl
   /*
   Usage: fossil sync ?URL? ?options?
   
   Synchronize the local repository with a remote repository.  This is
   the equivalent of running both "push" and "pull" at the same time.
   Use the "-R REPO" or "--repository REPO" command-line options
   to specify an alternative repository file.
   
   If a user-id and password are required, specify them as follows:
   
   http://userid:password@www.domain.com:1234/path
   
   If the URL is not specified, then the URL from the most recent successful
   clone, push, pull, remote-url, or sync command is used.
   
   The URL specified normally becomes the new "remote-url" used for
   subsequent push, pull, and sync operations.  However, the "--once" command-line
   option makes the URL a one-time-use URL that is not saved.
