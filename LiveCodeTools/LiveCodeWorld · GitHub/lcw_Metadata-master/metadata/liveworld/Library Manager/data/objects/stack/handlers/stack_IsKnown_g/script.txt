getprop stack_IsKnown
   -- misleading name. Could reame "opn_IsKnown"
   -- This script does not check all stackfiles, instead it only checks OPN stackfiles
   -- Can use "exist" for more general "is known"
   
   put the stack_Object of the target into stackObject
   if stackObject = the opn_Library of me then return true	# assume the opn_Library is known by Rev
   
   put the short name of stackObject into stackName
   put library_GetStackFile (stackName) into relativeFile
   if relativeFile is empty then
      return false
   else
      put the effective filename of stackObject into someFile
      put rev_PluginFullPath (relativeFile) into testFile
      return testFile = someFile
