function googleEarth_GetGetPointOnTerrain openglLoc
    /*
    set results to results & {GetPointOnTerrain {0, 0}}
    (* The {0, 0} is in standard OpenGL coordinates; the space you draw
    in with the projection and modelview matrices set to the identity.
    {-1, -1} is the bottom left, {1, -1} is the bottom right, {1, 1} is
    the top right, and the rest should be obvious. We pick the center. *) 
    
    The return value of GetPointOnTerrainFromScreenCoords
    is a SAFEARRAY of Latitude in decimal degrees, Longitude in decimal degrees, and altitude (of the terrain point) in meters.
    
    The trick is reading a SAFEARRAY. In VBA it can be done with a Variant,
    in C++ there are functions for SAFEARRAYs,
    and there is a relatively straightforward way to do it in C#, but I don't know what it is.
