function shell_Md5Hash someFile
  -- On Linux you can use the "md5sum" utility, 
  -- on OSX the "md5" command 
  -- On Win you may need to build your own utility 
  -- but there are many very simple, single file sources available, with no library dependencies, 
  -- so you could build and distribute your own executable for Win32.
  -- (Or you could download the Microsoft utility to do this - fciv - from http://support.microsoft.com/?kbid=841290 )
