setprop view_Height someHeight
   if the height of me = someHeight then pass view_Height -- should we only do this when it has changed?
   
   lock screen
   put the long owner of me into myOwner
   put the rect of myOwner into oRect
   set the height of me to someHeight 
   dispatch "LayoutControl" to myOwner with oRect -- experimental  allows a container to resize itself
   unlock screen
end view_Height
