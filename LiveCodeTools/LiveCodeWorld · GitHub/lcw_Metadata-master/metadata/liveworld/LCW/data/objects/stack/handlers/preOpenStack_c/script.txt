on preOpenStack
   -- bug:  revSaving sends openStack and preOpenStack is sent every time any stack is saved ???
   -- should be sent to the first card of this stack
   -- but targetStackName is "revSaving" 
   put the short name of the defaultstack into targetStackName -- same as the stack_Name
   put the short name of me into myName
   if targetStackName is not myName then
      pass preOpenStack
   else
      start using me
   end if
end preOpenStack
