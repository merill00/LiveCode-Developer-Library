/*
This is the Livecode Wolrd Home stack.

Here we experiment with a minimal script-only definition of a general project home stack.
It should do everything that is needed to get the project up and running, but nothing more.
It should:

-  have no dependencies
-  not depend on script introspection
-  use robust file naming concentions
-  human readable and easy to parse in any language
-  a simple text stack that plays well with revision control

This is a new beginning.

/*
When initialising we use "me" not "the target".
These are not library functions. To be robust they should only work in the context of this stack.
These handlers are private as we want to control how this stack is used to keep everything simple.

-- see related "project_StartEnvironment" and "project_StopEnvironment"
