Eating a vegetarian diet has a moderating impact not only on the body, but on the environment as well. The opposite is gluttony. </p>

Other diets create a different chemistry, which affects your endocrine glands and your entire system all day long. A vegetarian diet helps your system all day long. Food is chemistry, and chemistry affects consciousness; and if our goal is higher consciousness, we have to provide the chemistry that evokes it.Ó</p>
