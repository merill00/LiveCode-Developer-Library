    Description
    Returns the three most important attributes from an HTML &lt;input&gt; tag: 'type', 'name' and 'value'. 
    Supports attribute values that are double- or single-quoted or unquoted. 
    Returns four references, the first being the name of the attribute, and the other three being the value,
    of which only one will be populated based on the way the value was quoted.
