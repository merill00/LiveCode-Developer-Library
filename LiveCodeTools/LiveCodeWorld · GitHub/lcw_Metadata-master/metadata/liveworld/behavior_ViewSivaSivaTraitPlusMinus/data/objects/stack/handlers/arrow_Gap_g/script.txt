getprop arrow_Gap [innerWidth]
   -- this is the gap between the trait and the top of the line
   -- you may need to set this if you choose to show arrow heads
   -- because unfortunately Livecode does not include the arrow in legnth calculations.
   
   -- this value works well with oval graphics
   return -3
   
   put item 1 of the margins of me into someMargin
   put _arrowTopFactor() * someMargin into arrowGap
   
   put round (innerWidth * 0.05) into arrowHeight
   return arrowHeight
end arrow_Gap
