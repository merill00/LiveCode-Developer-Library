/*
* The form request appleEvent class is equivalent to request appleEvent data
with keyword "evcl". It gets the four-character class the Apple event belongs to (for example, misc or aevt).
* The form request appleEvent id is equivalent to request appleEvent data 
with keyword "evid". It gets the four-character name of the specific Apple event (for example, dosc or eval).
* The form request appleEvent sender is equivalent to request appleEvent data
with keyword "addr". It gets the AppleTalk address of the program that sent the Apple event to Revolution.
* The form request appleEvent returnID is equivalent to request appleEvent data
with keyword "rtid". It gets the Apple event's return id number.
 
* The form request appleEvent data gets the data associated with the Apple event. 
The meaning of this data depends on which kind of Apple event is being handled. 
For example, the odoc (open document) event sends the file path of the document being opened as the Apple event data.
For more information about Apple events, see Apple Computer's technical documentation,
Inside Macintosh: Interapplication Communication, located at
