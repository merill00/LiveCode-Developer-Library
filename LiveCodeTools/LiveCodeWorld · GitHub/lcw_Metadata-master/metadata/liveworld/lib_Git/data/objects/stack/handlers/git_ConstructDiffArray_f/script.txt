   /*
   Chunk header format is modified to prevent people from accidentally feeding it to patch -p1. Combined diff format was created for review of merge commit changes, and was not meant for apply. The
   change is similar to the change in the extended index header:
   
   @@@ <from-file-range> <from-file-range> <to-file-range> @@@
   There are (number of parents + 1) @ characters in the chunk header for combined diff format.
   Unlike the traditional unified diff format, which shows two files A and B with a single column that has - (minus -- appears in A but removed in B), + (plus -- missing in A but added to B), or " " (space
   -- unchanged) prefix, this format compares two or more files file1, file2,... with one file X, and shows how X differs from each of fileN. One column for each of fileN is prepended to the output line to
   note how X's line is different from it.
