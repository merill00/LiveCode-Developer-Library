   /*
   git rm Documentation/\*.txt
   Removes all *.txt files from the index that are under the Documentation directory and any of its subdirectories.
   
   Note that the asterisk * is quoted from the shell in this example; this lets git, and not the shell, expand the pathnames of files and subdirectories under the Documentation/ directory.
   
   git rm -f git-*.sh
   Because this example lets the shell expand the asterisk (i.e. you are listing the files explicitly), it does not remove subdir/git-foo.sh.
