/*
This stack contains handlers to log LiveDaemon server events.

We can neatly add or remove logging these events by adding or removing this script from the behavior chain.
This keeps the lib_Daemon serve scripts clean and minimal.
You can also speeds up the server by removing all the logging with one command and no ifs.
