getprop view_ToolMenu [pItems]
   put the long id of the target into targetObject
   put the view_Object of targetObject into someView
   if exists(someView) is false then put targetObject into someView
   
   put the menu_ToolTitle of targetObject into mTitle -- searches so more danger of recursion   
   put menu_GetTextFromTitleTable (mTitle, targetObject) into mText
   return mText
