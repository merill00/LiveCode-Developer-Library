command menu_SetText pMenuTitle, pClearMenuGlobal
   -- a simple utility (not same as old "menu_SetText")
   -- to allow changing "menu_PopUp pMenuTitle" to "menu_SetText pMenuTitle" in option buttons
   -- replace ",-," with CR in pMenuTitle -- so multiple titles can be put on one line
   replace comma with CR in pMenuTitle -- so multiple titles can be put on one line
   
   put the long id of the target into pTargetObject
   if pMenuTitle is empty then put the menu_ToolOrTitle of pTargetObject into pMenuTitle
   if pMenuTitle is empty then put "Menu" into pMenuTitle
   
   set the menu_TextFromTitle of pTargetObject to pMenuTitle
   put the result into mText
   if pClearMenuGlobal is true then menu_ClearTargetGlobals
   return mText
end menu_SetText
