   -u, --update
   Update only files that git already knows about, staging modified content for commit and marking
   deleted files for removal. This is similar to what "git commit -a" does in preparation for making a
   commit, except that the update is limited to paths specified on the command line. If no paths are
   specified, all tracked files in the current directory and its subdirectories are updated.
