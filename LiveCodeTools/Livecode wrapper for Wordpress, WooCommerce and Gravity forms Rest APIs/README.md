# Wordpress API - Livecode Client
A Livecode wrapper for Wordpress, WooCommerce and Gravity forms Rest APIs.

WordPress is the most widely used open source app in the world, but there is no way to easily develop native apps for iOS, Android and desktops. Enter LiveCode, the easiest to use open source native app development tool. The code in this project is intended to bridge the gap between WordPress and native apps developed in LiveCode.

Forked from the original Digital Pomagranite livecode-wp-restapi. I created this fork to implement changes to the library to fit the style of coding I prefer. This library will eventually implement better authentication than the Basic Authentication offered by the original library.

## Roadmap

- [X] Create initial fork
- [] Convert library to script only stacks
- [] Create unit tests with a TBD Livecode testing framework
- [] Refactor code
- [] Add JWT authentication
- [] Implement tsNet async calls for appropriate Livecode licenses
- [] Create documentation on how to use the Library
