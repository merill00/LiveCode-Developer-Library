# Remove non-core widgets for LiveCode 8

Some widgets were removed from the IDE, since LiveCode 8.0.0 will lack some features required to make them work well:

* checkbox
* progressbar
* pushbutton
* radiobutton
* selector

Additionally, some widgets intended for use internally by the IDE were hidden from the tools palette:

* colorswatch
* gradientrampeditor
