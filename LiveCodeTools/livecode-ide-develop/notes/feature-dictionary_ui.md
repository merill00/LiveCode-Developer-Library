# Dictionary UI Improvements

The dictionary stack UI has been updated to incorporate a few user interface
improvements:

* The panel containing list of entries that match the current filter and 
search terms is now resizable, and contains three columns - the name of 
the entry, the type, and the syntax. The list can be sorted by any of 
these three.
* The history breadcrumb has been condensed into back and forward buttons,
plus a history dropdown menu button.
* The filters pane now has associations and platforms filter categories, 
and is now scrollable if the content is too large for the pane. The numbers
associated with each filter have been removed. The list of filters is laid 
out in two columns, sorted in alphabetical order.
