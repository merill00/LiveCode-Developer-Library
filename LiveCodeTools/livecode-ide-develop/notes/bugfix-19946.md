# Add extension search folders preference
Any folder containing a folder containing an extension selected for 
loading by the user is added to the `cDeveloperExtensionsFolders` 
preference. There is now a new preference 
`cDeveloperExtensionsActiveFolders` which controls which of the 
folders are actually searched for extensions in the extension 
builder. This preference can be set using the cog at the top-right 
of the extension builder stack.
