## The MadPink Uber-Controls Widget For Livecode

Visit wiki for details. Released under CC BY-SA 4.0, built with Livecode and love.

Visit [mpControls Planning Board](https://madpink.plutio.com/p/sgjnnwx7q7etcwpfg) to see current plans and progress.

### Some quick terminology
* A "control" is an individual button, switch and other items drawn within the widget.
* The "bottom buttons" are an optional set of confirmation/action buttons which are handled separatly from the rest of the controls.
* The "working area" is defined as the rectangle within the widget where controls are drawn. This area excludes the title, border and bottom buttons.

### Contains several different control types:
* Button Bar (or Button Grid)
* Dialog Box or Text Display
* Form Backdrop
* Numeric Up/Down Adjusters
* Sliders
* Switches/Checkboxes

One more addendum to the LICENSE... please keep line 42 as "-- Don't Panic"... it's an old programming idiosyncrasy I like keeping in place.
